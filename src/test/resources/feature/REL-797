As a user I'd like to have the ability of creation a Jira linked story.

1. Add controls to the New story pop-up:
- Jira-linked check-box - it is active only if Jira path and account are validated. Otherwise tooltip is "Set up Jira at Project settings page"
- "Jira key*" label
- Jira key select

2. Show Jira key label and select only when Jira-linked check-box is checked.

3. Jira key select contains a list of set-up Jira project (at the project settings page) user stories.

4. When user selected a jira issue:
- its Name (1 at the screenshot) is added to the Story name text-box
- identifier (2 at the screenshot) is proposed as story file name
- description (3 at the screenshot) is shown in the description text-area

All these data can be changed by user.

5. On Save click feature with entered data is created at Relime DB.
